### **Approach**
â€‹
The above idea, could be implemented with a queue. We initially keep an empty queue and push the root node. We also need to keep the left to right bool variable that keeps check of the current level we are in. As we traverse nodes in the queue, we need to push them in a temporary array. If left to right is false we need to reverse the array and push it in our data structure or else, simply push it in our data structure. In the end, when we have finished traversing the current level, we need to toggle our left to the right variable.
