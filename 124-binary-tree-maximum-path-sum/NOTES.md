### **Approach**
​
We need to traverse the left path and right path of a node & need to calculate which is maximum ie which side produces max sum by summing up current node value and its adjacent left/right path.
​
We also need maintain a maxSum which will strore the max sum of a given curve ie summation of root node, left and right node.
