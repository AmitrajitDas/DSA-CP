**Approach:** Boundary traversal in an anti-clockwise direction can be described as a traversal consisting of three parts:

Part 1: Left Boundary of the tree (excluding the leaf nodes).
Part 2: All the leaf nodes travelled in the left to right direction.
Part 3: Right Boundary of the tree (excluding the leaf nodes), traversed in the reverse direction.
